## Weather Checker

Weather checker is an application made using React.js that fetches data using a weather API. It was a really fun experience to
finally have some basic exposure to React. 

It's the first JavaScript framework I've tried, and I really enjoyed it. Hopefully, I can build a few more projects with other API's.
