## Weather Checker

Weather checker is an application made using React.js that fetches data using a weather API. It was a really fun experience to
finally have some basic exposure to React. 

It's the first JavaScript framework I've tried, and I really enjoyed it. Hopefully, I can build a few more projects with other API's.

* CSS3 (Bootstrap)
* JavaScript (React.js)

## Ackknowledgement
This project was inspired by Hamza Mirza. I've always wanted to have a look at React.js, and how it interacts with API's as well as the DOM. This was a great project to gain basic exposure to React.js.
